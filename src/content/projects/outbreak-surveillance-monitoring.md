**Project Summary**

**Goals and Objectives**

- Goal 1: Identify sources and APIs for pulling data by date, i.e., google search statistics, xweets, facebook, google scholar, news, case reports, CDC, WHO
- Goal 2: Define report data expected and reporting format
- Goal 3: Prototype summary and extraction workflow for relevant outbreak data

**Approach**

- Text extraction, text chunking, figure parsing, tabular data processing, APIs
- Prototype of reporting tool

**Data and Resources Required**

| Resource Type     | Source / Link                                                      | Description / Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Data              | Internet (Broad), Social media                                     | Data mining for infection data                      |
| Tools / Services  | APIs to all major data services (might need to set up before hand) | Data mining                                         |
| LLMs / AI Models  | FireCrawl, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini                                  | Data extraction and summary                         |
| Compute / Storage | \<1TB for prototype                                                | Store downloaded files and extracted (cleaned) data |

**Expected Outcomes / Deliverables**

- Prototype of outbreak tracking with outcome

**Potential Impact and Next Steps**

- Infectious disease research or surveillance: The project is infectious disease surveillance
- AI/ML automation and interpretability: The project is infectious disease surveillance using AI and output in interpretable sentences
- Public health preparedness or education: The project is infectious disease surveillance using AI and output in interpretable sentences with a mind to eventually be good enough for public health preparedness

**Technical Support Needed**

- API keys (ideally set up before project start)
- Mentor support

**Additional Comments**

API keys would ideally be set up before project start
