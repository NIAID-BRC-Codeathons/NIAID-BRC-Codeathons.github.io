**Project Summary**

*(4-6 sentences describing the problem, its relevance to infectious disease research, and the AI/ML innovation your team will pursue.)*

**Goals and Objectives**

List 2–4 measurable goals your team aims to achieve during the Codeathon.

* Goal 1: Identify sources and APIs for pulling data by date, i.e., google search statistics, xweets, facebook, google scholar, news, case reports, CDC, WHO  
* Goal 2: Define report data expected and reporting format  
* Goal 3: Prototype summary and extraction workflow for relevant outbreak data

**Approach**

* Text extraction, text chunking, figure parsing, tabular data processing, APIs  
* Prototype of reporting tool

*(Add a simple block diagram or numbered workflow if useful.)*

**Data and Resources Required**

| Resource Type | Source / Link | Description / Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Data | Internet (Broad), Social media | Data mining for infection data |
| Tools / Services | APIs to all major data services (might need to set up before hand) | Data mining |
| LLMs / AI Models | FireCrawl, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini | Data extraction and summary |
| Compute / Storage | \<1TB for prototype | Store downloaded files and extracted (cleaned) data |

**Expected Outcomes / Deliverables**

Describe tangible outputs expected by the end of the Codeathon:

* Prototype of outbreak tracking with outcome

**Potential Impact and Next Steps**

Explain how this project contributes to:

* Infectious disease research or surveillance: The project is infectious disease surveillance  
* AI/ML automation and interpretability: The project is infectious disease surveillance using AI and output in interpretable sentences  
* Public health preparedness or education: The project is infectious disease surveillance using AI and output in interpretable sentences with a mind to eventually be good enough for public health preparedness

*(Include possible follow-up activities after the Codeathon.)*

**Technical Support Needed**

Indicate additional requirements:

☐ Datasets preloaded  

☐ GPU / LLM access  

x☐ API keys  

x☐ Mentor support  

☐ Other ( )

**Additional Comments: API keys would ideally be set up before project start**
