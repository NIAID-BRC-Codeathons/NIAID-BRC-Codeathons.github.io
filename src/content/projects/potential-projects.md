**Potential Project Topics**

Participants will form teams and select from proposed themes or pitch new ideas:

1. **Virtual BRC Helpdesk**  
   Navigating the many organisms, datasets, and tools within the BRCs can be challenging. This project will build an AI-powered helpdesk to guide users in real time, helping them discover and use resources more effectively. By lowering the learning barrier, the outcome will be a user-friendly virtual assistant integrated across BRC platforms.
   1. Cross-BRC helpdesk \[??\]  

2. **Automated Workflow Generation and Execution**  
   Researchers often face difficulties turning biological questions into executable workflows. This project will develop AI tools that generate and run workflows from user descriptions or data, connecting BRC and external resources. The outcome will be a prototype that enables fast, reproducible, end-to-end analysis.
   1. BV-BRC workflow generation and execution \[Clark, Olson\]
   2. Galaxy workflow generation and execution \[Chris Grams\]
   3. Workflow evaluation framework \[Nick\]  

3. **Automated Knowledge Extraction and Curation from Literature**  
   Key biological insights, such as interactions between proteins, pathogens, drugs, and phenotypes, are often hidden in an ever-growing body of publications and hard to extract without spending significant manual curation effort. This project will apply AI to extract and curate such knowledge automatically. The outcome will be a continuously updated, machine-readable knowledge base to support infectious disease research.
   1. Extract sequence features / mutations from literature \[Indresh, Shubham\]
   2. Extract PPI from literature \[Ozan\] ??
   3. Annotate new subsystems from literature \[Ross, Gordon, Ralph\]

4. **Assign Functions to Uncharacterized Genes**  
   Many genes in priority and prototype pathogens lack functional annotation, slowing discovery of new biology. This project will use AI-driven approaches to predict functions for these uncharacterized genes. The outcome will be a scalable pipeline that provides functional insights to guide research into virulence, drug targets, and biomarkers.
   1. StoryBLAST \[Andrew Warren, GO guy\]
   2. Assign functions based on literature \[Rick / Tom / Arvind??\]
   3. Assign functions using ML classifiers \[Marcus, Justin, Alex, Christian Z?\]

5. **Outbreak Monitoring and Tracking**  
   Outbreak information is fragmented across surveillance reports, news articles, and scientific publications. This project will develop an AI system to track, collect, filter, and process outbreak data from diverse sources in real-time. The outcome will be a prototype dashboard for near real-time monitoring of emerging infectious threats, generation of comprehensive outbreak reports, or daily alerts.
   1. Outbreak tracker \[Nick, Curtis, Christian Z?\]

6. **Virtual AI Co-scientist**  
   Formulating and refining research hypotheses is labor-intensive and requires deep expertise. This project will create a multi-agent AI system that generates, debates, and ranks hypotheses based on user-defined goals. The outcome will be a prototype “virtual co-scientist” that helps accelerate hypothesis-driven research.
