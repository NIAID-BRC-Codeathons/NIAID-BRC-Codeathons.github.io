## Project Theme

**Outbreak Monitoring and Tracking**

## Project Summary

Infectious disease outbreaks require rapid detection and response, but information is scattered across news outlets, social media, official reports, and scientific publications. This project develops an AI-powered outbreak monitoring system that aggregates data from multiple sources, uses natural language processing to identify relevant signals, tracks geographic and temporal patterns, and provides real-time alerts and visualizations. By automating outbreak detection and tracking, we can enable faster public health response and better situational awareness.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Aggregate multi-source outbreak data** from news, social media, WHO, CDC, and other sources
2. **Detect outbreak signals** using AI-based filtering and relevance scoring
3. **Track geographic and temporal patterns** with automated mapping and timeline generation
4. **Generate automated reports** and alerts for emerging threats

## Approach

**Methods and AI/ML Approaches:**

- Web scraping and API integration for data collection
- Natural Language Processing for text analysis and entity extraction
- Named Entity Recognition for pathogens, locations, dates, and case counts
- Time series analysis for trend detection and forecasting
- Anomaly detection for identifying unusual patterns
- LLMs for report summarization and synthesis
- Geographic visualization and mapping

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Identify and integrate data sources (ProMED, HealthMap, news APIs, Twitter)
2. Build data collection and preprocessing pipeline
3. Implement NER for outbreak-relevant entities
4. Develop filtering and relevance scoring models
5. Create geographic and temporal tracking system
6. Build dashboard for visualization and alerts
7. Validate against known outbreak timelines
8. Integrate with BRC genomic surveillance data
