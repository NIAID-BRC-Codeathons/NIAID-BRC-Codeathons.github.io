## Project Goal

Create an AI-powered outbreak monitoring system that aggregates data from multiple sources, identifies relevant signals, tracks emerging threats, and provides real-time alerts and visualizations for public health response.

## Key Features

- Multi-source data integration (news, social media, official reports)
- AI-based signal detection and filtering
- Geographic and temporal tracking
- Automated reporting and visualization
- Integration with genomic surveillance data

## Technical Approach

- NLP for processing news and social media
- Named Entity Recognition for pathogens, locations, and dates
- Time series analysis for trend detection
- Geographic visualization and mapping
- Integration with BRC pathogen databases
- Anomaly detection for outbreak signals

## Expected Outcomes

- Prototype outbreak monitoring dashboard
- Automated alert system for emerging threats
- Validation against known outbreak timelines
- API for data access and integration
- Public repository with tools and documentation

## Target Users

- Public health officials and epidemiologists
- Infectious disease researchers
- BRC users tracking pathogen evolution
