## Project Theme

**Automated Workflow Generation and Execution**

## Project Summary

Bioinformatics workflows often require expertise in multiple tools, file formats, and execution environments. This project aims to build an AI system that understands natural language descriptions of scientific analyses and automatically generates, validates, and executes bioinformatics workflows using BRC tools and external resources. By translating research questions directly into executable pipelines, we can dramatically reduce the time from hypothesis to results and make complex analyses accessible to researchers without deep computational expertise.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Natural language to workflow translation** using LLMs to convert user descriptions into workflow specifications
2. **Automatic tool and parameter selection** based on input data types and analysis goals
3. **Workflow validation and optimization** to ensure correctness and efficiency
4. **Execute workflows** on BRC infrastructure with proper data management and provenance tracking

## Approach

**Methods and AI/ML Approaches:**
- Large Language Models for parsing research questions and generating workflow logic
- Workflow description languages (CWL, Nextflow, Snakemake, or Galaxy)
- BRC API integration for tool execution
- LLM-guided parameter optimization
- Knowledge graphs of tool relationships and compatibility

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Define common workflow patterns for infectious disease research
2. Create prompts for LLM-based workflow generation
3. Build a tool registry with BRC and external bioinformatics tools
4. Implement workflow generation pipeline (LLM â†’ workflow language)
5. Add validation layer to check workflow correctness
6. Execute generated workflows and capture results
7. Test with real research questions

## Data and Resources Required

| Resource Type | Source / Link | Description / Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Data** | BV-BRC sample datasets | Testing workflow execution |
| **Tools / Services** | BV-BRC analysis services API | Tool execution backend |
| **Tools / Services** | Galaxy, Nextflow, or Snakemake | Workflow engine |
| **LLMs / AI Models** | GPT-4, Claude 3, or Code Llama | Workflow generation |
| **Data** | Tool documentation and schemas | For tool selection and parameterization |
| **Compute / Storage** | HPC access for workflow execution | Run generated pipelines |

## Expected Outcomes / Deliverables

- **Prototype system** for natural language workflow generation
- **Library of example workflows** generated from research questions
- **Validation framework** for workflow correctness
- **API documentation** for BRC integration
- **Performance benchmarks** comparing manual vs. automated workflows
- **Public GitHub repository** with code, examples, and documentation
- **Demo video** showing end-to-end workflow generation

## Potential Impact and Next Steps

**Impact on:**
- **Infectious disease research:** Accelerates time from question to analysis results
- **AI/ML automation:** Advances AI-driven scientific workflow automation
- **Public health preparedness:** Enables rapid deployment of analysis pipelines during outbreaks

**Next Steps After Codeathon:**
- Expand tool registry to cover all BRC services
- Add interactive workflow refinement (user feedback loop)
- Implement workflow version control and sharing
- Create educational materials for teaching computational biology
- Integrate with BRC workspaces for seamless execution
