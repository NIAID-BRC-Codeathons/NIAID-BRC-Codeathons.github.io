## Project Goal

Build an AI system that can understand natural language descriptions of scientific analyses and automatically generate, validate, and execute bioinformatics workflows using BRC tools and external resources.

## Key Features

- Natural language to workflow translation
- Automatic tool and parameter selection
- Workflow validation and optimization
- Integration with BRC services and APIs
- Support for external data sources and tools

## Technical Approach

- LLM-based workflow generation
- Workflow description languages (CWL, Nextflow, Snakemake)
- BRC API integration for tool execution
- Parameter optimization using AI
- Workflow provenance tracking

## Expected Outcomes

- Prototype system for workflow generation
- Example workflows generated from natural language
- API documentation for BRC integration
- Performance benchmarks
- Public repository with examples

## Target Users

- Researchers without deep bioinformatics expertise
- Lab groups standardizing analysis pipelines
- Educators teaching computational biology
