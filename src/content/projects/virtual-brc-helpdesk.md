## Project Goal

Create an intelligent virtual helpdesk that uses AI and large language models to assist users with navigating BRC resources, answering bioinformatics questions, and guiding them through complex analysis workflows.

## Key Features

- Natural language query interface for BRC tools and data
- Context-aware assistance for common bioinformatics tasks
- Integration with BRC documentation and tutorials
- Step-by-step workflow guidance
- Code snippet generation for common operations

## Technical Approach

- LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, or open-source alternatives)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for BRC-specific knowledge
- Fine-tuning on BRC documentation and user queries
- Web-based chat interface

## Expected Outcomes

- Functional prototype of AI-powered helpdesk
- Evaluation metrics for response quality and accuracy
- Documentation for integration with existing BRC systems
- Public GitHub repository with code and examples

## Target Users

- New BRC users learning the platform
- Researchers exploring unfamiliar analysis types
- Developers integrating BRC tools into workflows
