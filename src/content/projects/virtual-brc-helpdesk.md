## Project Theme

**Virtual BRC Helpdesk**

## Project Summary

Many researchers find bioinformatics resources challenging to navigate, especially when learning new tools or trying unfamiliar analyses. This project aims to build an intelligent virtual helpdesk powered by AI and large language models that can assist users with navigating BRC resources, answering bioinformatics questions in natural language, and providing step-by-step guidance through complex analysis workflows. By lowering the barrier to entry, we can make BRC tools accessible to a broader community of infectious disease researchers.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Develop a conversational AI interface** that understands user queries about BRC tools, data, and workflows
2. **Integrate BRC documentation** using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, context-aware responses
3. **Generate executable code snippets** for common bioinformatics tasks on BRC platforms
4. **Create a prototype web interface** for users to interact with the virtual helpdesk

## Approach

**Methods and AI/ML Approaches:**
- Large Language Models (GPT-4, Claude, or open-source alternatives like Llama)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for BRC-specific knowledge
- Vector embeddings of BRC documentation, tutorials, and user guides
- Fine-tuning on BRC FAQs and support ticket history

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Collect and preprocess BRC documentation, tutorials, and help resources
2. Build a vector database of BRC knowledge for RAG
3. Design conversational prompts and system instructions
4. Develop a chat interface (web-based or API)
5. Test with common user queries and refine responses
6. Evaluate accuracy and usefulness with test users

## Data and Resources Required

| Resource Type | Source / Link | Description / Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Data** | BV-BRC tutorials, documentation, FAQs | Training corpus for RAG system |
| **Data** | User forum questions/answers | Real-world query examples |
| **Tools / Services** | BV-BRC API | For demonstrating tool usage |
| **LLMs / AI Models** | GPT-4, Claude 3, or Llama 3 | Core conversational AI |
| **Tools / Services** | LangChain, LlamaIndex | RAG framework |
| **Compute / Storage** | Vector database (Pinecone, Chroma, or Weaviate) | Store document embeddings |

## Expected Outcomes / Deliverables

- **Functional prototype** of AI-powered helpdesk with chat interface
- **RAG pipeline** for BRC documentation retrieval
- **Evaluation metrics** for response quality, accuracy, and helpfulness
- **Code repository** on GitHub with documentation and examples
- **Integration roadmap** for deploying on BRC platforms
- **Demo presentation** showing real user interactions

## Potential Impact and Next Steps

**Impact on:**
- **Infectious disease research:** Lowers barrier for researchers to access powerful bioinformatics tools
- **AI/ML automation:** Demonstrates practical application of LLMs for scientific support
- **Public health preparedness:** Enables rapid onboarding of new users during outbreaks

**Next Steps After Codeathon:**
- Expand knowledge base to include all BRC resources
- Add multi-turn conversation capabilities
- Integrate with BRC user authentication for personalized help
- Deploy as a widget on BRC websites
- Collect user feedback and continuously improve
