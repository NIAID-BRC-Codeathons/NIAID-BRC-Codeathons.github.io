## Project Goal

Leverage AI and machine learning to predict functions for hypothetical and uncharacterized genes in bacterial and viral pathogens, integrating multiple data types including sequence, structure, expression, and genomic context.

## Key Features

- Multi-modal AI models for function prediction
- Integration of sequence, structure, and context data
- Prediction confidence scoring
- Visualization of predicted functions and evidence
- Batch processing for genome-scale analysis

## Technical Approach

- Deep learning on protein sequences and structures
- Integration with AlphaFold structure predictions
- Genomic context analysis (operons, neighborhoods)
- Transfer learning from well-characterized organisms
- Ensemble methods combining multiple prediction approaches

## Expected Outcomes

- Functional predictions for uncharacterized genes
- Confidence metrics and validation strategies
- Comparison with existing annotation tools
- Web interface for function prediction
- Public repository and API

## Target Users

- Genome annotators and curators
- Researchers studying emerging pathogens
- Comparative genomics researchers
