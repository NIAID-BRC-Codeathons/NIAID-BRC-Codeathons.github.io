## Project Theme

**Assign Functions to Uncharacterized Genes**

## Project Summary

A significant portion of genes in bacterial and viral pathogens remain uncharacterized or annotated only as "hypothetical proteins." This project uses AI and machine learning to predict functions for these genes by integrating multiple data types including sequence, structure, genomic context, and expression patterns. By combining deep learning on protein sequences, AlphaFold structure predictions, and comparative genomics, we aim to provide functional annotations with confidence scores, helping researchers understand pathogen biology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Develop multi-modal AI models** for function prediction integrating sequence, structure, and context
2. **Generate functional predictions** for hypothetical proteins in priority pathogens
3. **Provide confidence scores** and supporting evidence for predictions
4. **Create visualization tools** for exploring predictions and evidence

## Approach

**Methods and AI/ML Approaches:**
- Deep learning on protein sequences (transformers, CNNs)
- Structure-based function prediction using AlphaFold models
- Genomic context analysis (operons, gene neighborhoods, synteny)
- Transfer learning from well-characterized model organisms
- Ensemble methods combining multiple prediction approaches
- Graph neural networks for protein-protein interaction prediction

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Compile datasets of characterized proteins for training
2. Extract features: sequences, structures, genomic context
3. Train and validate multi-modal prediction models
4. Generate predictions for hypothetical proteins in BRC
5. Implement confidence scoring and evidence aggregation
6. Build visualization interface for predictions
7. Validate predictions with experimental data where available
