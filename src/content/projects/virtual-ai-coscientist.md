## Project Goal

Build an advanced multi-agent AI system that acts as a virtual research collaborator, capable of generating novel scientific hypotheses, evaluating them through simulated debate, and ranking them by feasibility and potential impact.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles
- Hypothesis generation from research questions
- Agent-based debate and critique
- Evidence gathering from literature and databases
- Hypothesis ranking and prioritization
- Experimental design suggestions

## Technical Approach

- Multi-agent LLM framework (AutoGen, CrewAI, or custom)
- Specialized agents (Generator, Critic, Evaluator, etc.)
- Integration with scientific literature and BRC databases
- Reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting
- Consensus mechanisms for hypothesis ranking

## Expected Outcomes

- Functional multi-agent prototype
- Generated hypotheses with supporting evidence
- Evaluation framework for hypothesis quality
- Case studies on infectious disease questions
- Public repository and documentation

## Target Users

- Researchers exploring new areas of investigation
- Grant writers developing research proposals
- Educators teaching scientific reasoning
- Computational biologists automating literature review
