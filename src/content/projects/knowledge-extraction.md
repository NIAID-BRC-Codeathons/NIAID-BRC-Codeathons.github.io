## Project Goal

Develop AI-powered tools to automatically extract, structure, and curate biological knowledge from scientific literature, databases, and other sources to enhance BRC data annotations and enable knowledge discovery.

## Key Features

- Automated extraction of gene functions, pathways, and relationships
- Entity recognition for pathogens, genes, proteins, and phenotypes
- Relationship extraction and knowledge graph construction
- Integration with existing BRC curation pipelines
- Literature monitoring and update mechanisms

## Technical Approach

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for biological entities
- Relation extraction using transformers
- Knowledge graph construction and validation
- Integration with PubMed, PMC, and other literature sources
- Automated curation confidence scoring

## Expected Outcomes

- Prototype knowledge extraction pipeline
- Extracted knowledge graphs for priority pathogens
- Evaluation of extraction accuracy
- Integration plan for BRC databases
- Public repository with tools and examples

## Target Users

- BRC curators and database maintainers
- Researchers exploring pathogen biology
- Bioinformaticians building knowledge bases
